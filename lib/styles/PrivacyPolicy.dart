    "One of the biggest obstacles is a lack of knowledge about what constitutes a healthy diet, which can lead to poor eating habits, excessive calorie consumption, and insufficient nutrient intake.  Additionally, keeping track of calorie intake and adhering to recommended guidelines can be overwhelming and time-consuming.  Many people struggle to accurately monitor their food intake, and they may not have the resources or time to weigh and measure every meal. Lack of motivation to exercise is another issue for many individuals. They may find it hard to fit exercise into their busy schedules or dislike conventional forms of physical activity. As a result, a sedentary lifestyle can increase the risk of chronic diseases and weight gain. Lastly, it can be tough for people to track their progress, which can make it difficult to stay motivated and committed to healthy eating and exercise habits.";
